I have created a productivity system 🪐 that helps me to code, write, create and live at my maximum capabilities without getting boring, tiredness, or being fog.

My productivity system stays on 3 main pillars:

- Schedule
- TODO for tomorrow

## 📆 Schedule 📆
**My schiedule looks like this:**

7 AM to 8:30 AM: Meditation, Sport, Shower.

8:30 AM to 9:00 AM: Breakfast.

9:00 AM to 12:00 PM: My 3 hours programming time.

12:00 PM to 1:00 PM: Lunch and go out walking for 15–20 minutes.

1:00 PM to 6:00/7:00/8:00 PM: My Next hours for coding.

8:00 to 9:00 PM: Family Time, Watch a movie or something.

DO NOT FORGET TO SLEEP 8 HOURS A DAY.

## 📝 TODO for tomorrow 📝
I create my To-Do list in the evening for tomorrow day.

I create my To-Do list for tomorrow, and not in the morning because it saves my productivity time and my energy attention.
